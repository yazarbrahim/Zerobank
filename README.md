Zerobank-Automation
Team worked on this bank project with Ekrem Kose and Ibrahim Yazar. It was a partial test project. 
Some pre-defined user stories were tested by automation. 
User stories were about only user interface.
Framework is basically established on "Maven-Selenium- Cucumber-JUnit" test automation tools.
We have developed the framework based on Page Object Model design pattern and Java is my programming language.
Following features were tested:
•	Account activity page
•	Login page
•	Pay Bills page
•   Account Summary page
